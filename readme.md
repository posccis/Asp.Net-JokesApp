## âž•More about the exercise

â€‹	It's a crash course from the freeCodeCamp.org(ðŸŽ¥https://youtu.be/BfEjDD8mWYg ). For me it also was a real introduction to the Asp.Net framework, cause i was in doubt if i should study Spring Framework with Java or Asp.Net with C#, but after some research i decide to study Asp.

## âž•Some views 

 	The framework is very fast and generate very quickly a lot of code for the developer. With some clicks you can have a home page with login and register and also make the migration with the data base and create the controller you also can have a view with a complete CRUD for your table.
